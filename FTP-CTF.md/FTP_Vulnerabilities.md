# FTP Vulnerabilities Overview

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of files between a client and server on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server. Initially designed in the 1970s, FTP is one of the oldest protocols for transferring files but is still widely used due to its simplicity and wide support.

## FTP operates on two communication channels:
- **Control Channel**: Used for sending commands and responses between the client and server.
- **Data Channel**: Used for transferring files.
While FTP is effective for basic file transfer tasks, it lacks security features necessary for safe and confidential data transmission, leading to several vulnerabilities.

## 1. Lack of Encryption
- FTP transmits data, including credentials, in plain text. This poses a major security risk as data can be intercepted and read by anyone who can access the network traffic. Ultimately this may lead to potential data breaches, exposure of sensitive information, and credential compromise.

## 2. Anonymous Access/Weak Authentication
- FTP servers often allow anonymous access or have weak authentication mechanisms, where login credentials are either not required or are easily guessable. Creating a vector for attackers to gain unauthorized access to files, enabling data theft, unauthorized file uploads, and potential system compromise.

## 3. Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities
- Some FTP servers are vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks, where excessively long commands can overflow memory buffers which can result in arbitrary code execution or server crashes, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).

## 4. FTP Bounce Attack
-  Exploits the FTP PORT command to scan ports on machines behind a firewall by 'bouncing' the connection through an FTP server allowing attackers to obfuscate their location and potentially exploit vulnerabilities on other networked machines.

## 5. Command Injection
- Certain FTP implementations may be susceptible to command injection, where malicious commands are injected or appended to legitimate FTP commands. This can lead to unauthorized actions on the server, which can include data manipulation, unauthorized access, or server compromise.


These vulnerabilities highlight the key security risks associated with the traditional FTP protocol. The use of secure alternatives such as FTPS (FTP Secure) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol), which provide encrypted data transfers, is generally recommended to mitigate these issues.
