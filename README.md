## Introduction
  Welcome to our repository dedicated to exploring network service vulnerabilities through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. This repository is designed to present a list of the most common vulnerabilities found in various network services, complemented by practical CTF walkthroughs and security hardening recommendations.

## Repository Structure
  This repository is organized into individual folders for each network service covered. Within each folder, you will find:
- **CTF Walkthrough**: Step-by-step guides for completing CTF challenges related to the specific service.
- **Executive Summary**: Brief summaries highlighting key tactics and insights from the CTF challenges.
- **List of Common Vulnerabilities**: A compilation of the most common vulnerabilities associated with each service.
- **Hardening Strategies**: Recommendations on how to secure the services against these vulnerabilities.

## How to Navigate
  Browse through the repository to find specific services of interest. Each folder provides a comprehensive look at the vulnerabilities commonly associated with that service, alongside practical examples from CTF challenges and hardening techniques.
